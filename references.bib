  abstract = {An invaluable tool for anyonecarrying out a research projectWe all learn to do research by actually doing it,but a great deal of time and effort can be wastedand goodwill dissipated by inadequate preparation.This book provides beginner researcherswith the tools to do the job, to help them avoidsome of the pitfalls and time-wasting false trails,and to establish good research habits. It takesresearchers from the stage of choosing a topicthrough to the production of a well-planned,methodologically sound, and well-written finalreport or thesis on time. It is written in plainEnglish and makes no assumptions about previousknowledge. This new edition of Doing Your ResearchProject includes: Coverage of latest techniques such asgrounded theory A new chapter on ethics Increased examples from health studies New referencing, library searching, andliterature review chapters Completely updated references throughout This book serves as a guide to good practice forbeginner researchers in any discipline embarkingon undergraduate or postgraduate study, andfor professionals in such fields as social science,education, and health.},

@article{Hauke2011,
abstract = {Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is a nonparametric (distribution-free) rank statistic proposed by Charles Spearman as a measure of the strength of an association between two variables. It is a measure of a monotone association that is used when the distribution of data makes Pearson's correlation coefficient undesirable or misleading. Spearman's coefficient is not a measure of the linear relationship between two variables, as some statisticians declare. It assesses how well an arbitrary monotonic function can describe a relationship between two variables, without making any assumptions about the frequency distribution of the variables. Unlike Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient, it does not require the assumption that the relationship between the variables is linear, nor does it require the variables to be measured on interval scales; it can be used for variables measured at the ordinal level. The idea of the paper is to compare the values of Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient as well as their statistical significance for different sets of data (original - for Pearson's coefficient, and ranked data for Spearman's coefficient) describing regional indices of socio-economic development.},
